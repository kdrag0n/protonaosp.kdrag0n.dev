# Supported devices

ProtonAOSP officially supports the following devices:

- Pixel 4 (flame)
- Pixel 4 XL (coral)
- Pixel 4a 5G (bramble)
- Pixel 5 (redfin)
- Pixel 6 (oriole)
- Pixel 6 Pro (raven)

If your device is listed, great! You can proceed to [installation](install/install.md).

If not, you're out of luck unless you're a developer and [port it yourself](developers/build.md#create-a-device-tree).
