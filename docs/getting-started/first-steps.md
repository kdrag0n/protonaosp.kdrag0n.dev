# First steps

Once you have ProtonAOSP installed, you don't need to do anything else. The OS works entirely by itself. Enjoy!

You may find it helpful to explore options for [Google services.](../advanced/google-services.md)

## Explore

If you want to explore all the features, here are some suggestions:

- Check out the wallpapers, clocks, accent colors, and more theming options in Settings -> Display -> Styles & wallpapers
- Block internet access for apps that don't need it
- Try both the light and dark themes
- Try all the ringtone, alarm, or notification sounds included out-of-the-box

Most of ProtonAOSP's improvements work seamlessly in the background, bringing. That means you don't need to change anything -- just flash and forget. See [Features](../discover/features.md) for a list of differences to look for.

## Security

For security, consider [re-locking the bootloader](../advanced/verified-boot.md) to enforce verified boot, which improves physical security and resistance to persistent attacks.

## Advanced users

If you are an advanced user, you may be interested in [rooting](../advanced/rooting.md).
