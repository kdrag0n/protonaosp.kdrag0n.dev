# Manual install

This is a guide for installing ProtonAOSP manually, using the command line. The [web installer](web.mdx) is recommended if you don't have a specific need for this. Check the [list of common misconceptions](install.md#web-installer-misconceptions) if you're not sure.

You can only use a Windows, macOS, or Linux computer for this manual installation; use the [web installer](web.mdx) if you want to install from a Chromebook or another phone.

## Download a build {#download}

[Download](../download.md) the build you want to install. You can choose either factory images or full OTA packages -- both are covered below. We recommend factory images, unless you're already familiar with flashing full OTAs and would rather stick with them.

## Prepare your phone {#prepare-phone}

Put your device into bootloader mode by restarting it and holding the **volume down** button until you see a <span className="text--danger">red</span> warning sign or <span className="text--success">green</span> Android robot.

Once your device is in bootloader mode, plug it into the computer or device you’re installing from. Make sure you use a **high-quality** USB cable, as many cables will cause issues. Avoid USB hubs if possible.

Your USB cable needs to be able to copy files. Charging-only cables won’t work.

If you're switching from the stock OS or another ROM, make sure all your important data is backed up. You'll need to wipe all your data in order to use ProtonAOSP.

## Prepare your system {#prepare-system}

<TabItem value="windows">

First, open the "Command Prompt" app from the Start menu.

Next, download the [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) and extract them. Navigate to the extracted `platform-tools` folder in the terminal by typing `cd `&nbsp;(with the space at the end) and dragging the folder into Command Prompt. Then run the following command:

```bat
set PATH=%CD%;%PATH%
```

If it's your first time installing from this computer, you also need to install drivers:

1. Open Settings → Windows Update
1. Click "Check for updates" and wait
1. Click "View optional updates"
1. Select the "Android Bootloader Interface" update (ignore the brand name; it doesn't matter)
1. Click "Download and install" and wait for it to finish
1. Unplug your device and plug it back in

<TabItem value="mac">

First, open the "Terminal" app from Applications -> Utilities.

Next, download the [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) and extract them. Navigate to the extracted `platform-tools` folder in the terminal by typing `cd `&nbsp;(with the space at the end) and dragging the folder into Terminal. Then run the following command:

```bash
export PATH="$PWD:$PATH"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux">

First, open your terminal app of choice, such as Gnome Terminal, Konsole, or XTerm.

Next, install the Android platform tools. If you're using Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -S android-tools
```

On other distributions, download the [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) and extract them. Navigate to the extracted `platform-tools` folder in the terminal by typing `cd `&nbsp;(with the space at the end) and dragging the folder into your terminal. Then run the following command:

```bash
export PATH="$PWD:$PATH"
```

If it's your first time installing from this computer, you also need to install udev rules so that the tools can talk to your phone:

| Distribution   | Command |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Arch Linux     | `sudo pacman -S android-udev` |
| Debian, Ubuntu | `sudo apt install android-sdk-platform-tools-common` |
| Other          | Instructions vary |

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Wipe data

If you're switching from the stock OS or another ROM, you need to **wipe all data before installing ProtonAOSP**:

```bash
fastboot -w
```

Otherwise, ProtonAOSP won't boot and your phone will get stuck on the boot animation after the installation.

:::danger

All data on your phone will be lost, so make sure your important files are backed up before doing this.

## Install the build

### Factory images

#### Extract factory images

Extract the downloaded factory images package (e.g. `proton-aosp_redfin-factory_11.5.0.zip`). Navigate to the new folder (e.g. `redfin-rq2a.210505.003`) by typing `cd `&nbsp;(with the space at the end) and dragging the folder into your terminal.

#### Flash factory images

Run the following command to flash the factory images:

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue={detectOs()}
  values={[
    {label: "Windows", value: "windows"},
    {label: "macOS", value: "mac"},
    {label: "Linux", value: "linux"},
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="windows">

```batch
flash-all.bat
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac">

```bash
./flash-all.sh
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux">

```bash
./flash-all.sh
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Don’t touch, unplug, or press any buttons** on your device during the install. Your phone will restart several times, but **don’t touch it.** It will automatically boot into ProtonAOSP once the installation process completes.

### Full OTA

#### Download a custom recovery

Full OTAs can only be installed in a custom recovery, so you need to download one for your device first. We recommend [TWRP](https://twrp.me) for supported devices, such as the Pixel 2 series.

#### Boot the custom recovery

Run the following command to boot the custom recovery:

```bash
fastboot boot twrp-3.5.2_9-0-taimen.img
```

#### Sideload the package

After booting the custom recovery, you can install the full OTA package by sideloading it from your computer:

```bash
adb sideload proton-aosp_taimen-ota_11.5.0.zip
```

#### Restart your phone

Watch the phone for installation progress. Once it's finished, restart your phone using the buttons in the custom recovery.

## Finish

You can now delete the factory images and/or full OTA packages, but don't delete the platform tools -- you'll need them for updating in the future.

See [First Steps](getting-started/first-steps.md) for what to do next.

For security, you may also wish to [re-lock the bootloader](../../advanced/verified-boot.md) to enforce verified boot, which improves physical security and resistance against persistent attacks. Please note that this option is only available if you installed ProtonAOSP with factory images; it is not possible to re-lock the bootloader if you installed a full OTA package.
