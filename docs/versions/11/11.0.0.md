# v11.0.0

Released on September 20, 2020.

This is the initial version of ProtonAOSP that started the project, before it had an official name. It was a small collection of improvements on Android 11 back when it was first released.

## Highlights

- Better performance than stock
- Enhanced typography (harmonious font selection)
- iOS blue accent color & dark theme colors
- New open-source Active Edge implementation written from scratch (currently force-enabled at medium sensitivity to take a screenshot on squeeze; settings will be added soon)
- UI tweaks from the Pixel stock ROM
- 3-row quick settings when no media is playing
- Glass blur in the notification shade and recents overview (with performance & quality tweaks)
- Up to 40x faster shared internal storage (emulated SD card) than stock Android 11, same as Android 10
- Instant screenshots with key combination
- Improved UI performance using Vulkan rendering backend
- Signature spoofing support for microG
- Internet & sensor permission controls from GrapheneOS
- Minor security hardening from GrapheneOS (nothing that hurts performance much)
- Screenshot preview dismisses faster and is cleared before taking a new screenshot
