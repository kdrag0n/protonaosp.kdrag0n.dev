# v11.3.2

Released on February 4, 2021.

This is a maintenance version on the OS side, but it pioneered the [web installer](getting-started/install/web.mdx) as a major change to custom ROM flashing that is still in use today.

## Changes

- Updated to February security patch
- Added new space wallpapers by Infinitum
- Updated visual voicemail configs
- Pixel 5 & 4a 5G: Added support for standalone 5G on T-Mobile
- **New easy-to-use web installer**

This version introduces a new easy-to-use [web installer](getting-started/install/web.mdx), which allows you to install and update the ROM from any computer or phone without using the command line. The installer works entirely within your web browser using WebUSB, which is supported by Google Chrome, as well as other browsers based on Chromium such as Brave and Microsoft Edge.
