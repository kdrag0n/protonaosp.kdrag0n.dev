# Early access

You can get early access to new versions and other updates by [pledging to kdrag0n on Patreon](https://patreon.com/kdrag0n). It's a great way to support the project and keep it alive while simultaneously getting benefits. Once you've pledged, you can [download or install early access builds](https://kdrag0n.dev/patreon) as soon as they're available.

Each version is released to the public a week after the early access release.
