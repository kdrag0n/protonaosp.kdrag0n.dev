# Theming

ProtonAOSP includes a dynamic wallpaper-based theme engine, different from Google's implementation for Pixel devices. It works automatically in the background and themes the system to match your wallpaper.

The **[Repainter app](https://repainter.kdrag0n.dev/?utm_source=protonaosp)** is recommended for customizing the theme to your liking. On ProtonAOSP, all of Repainter's diverse customization features are supported without root or additional setup.
