# Wallpapers

ProtonAOSP bundles wallpapers in the "Styles & wallpapers" app. Unlike most custom ROMs, however, we bundle wallpapers with category grouping, titles, attribution, and links to the sources -- just like Google's Pixel OS. See [Screenshots](discover/screenshots.mdx#wallpapers) for details.

Instead of adding system-static wallpapers as files, our [wallpaper stub package](https://github.com/ProtonAOSP/android_packages_apps_ProtonWallpaperStub) makes this rich metadata possible.
